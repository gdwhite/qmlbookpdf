# qmlbookpdf
A pdf version of the "Qt5 Cadaques" QML book (http://qmlbook.org and https://github.com/qmlbook) with bookmarks matching the online/html version (the pdf version only had chapter bookmarks without the underlying sections).

P.S. This was a quick and dirty/manual job I did for my own use after I realized I didn't have the time to research the Sphinx doc tool and/or the LaTeX to PDF process in order to automate the creation of the extended bookmarks.  I put it up here in case anyone else might be interested.
